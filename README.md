# Microservice Case Study 


## Uber enginerring: The Opportunities Microservice Provides 
  Starting from a monolithic to this grand microservice company. 
I want to do this case study because Uber is something that I use in my everyday life. 
Uber quickly grew and it was hard to keep track of everything that they were doing. The Monolithic service wasn't working anymore for the growing company and they quickly realized that they needed something else. 

  Taking a lot of time and effort, what did switch to a microservice do for the company? 

It reduced the overall system complexity while maintaining the flexibility associated with microservices. When Uber had their primary two monolithic services they ran into many operational issues that microservice solved. 



    1. Availability Risks 
    2. Risky, expensive deployments 
    3. Poor separation of concerns 
    4. Inefficient executions 

  The growing company went from a small number of engineers to have 100s. Soon realizing that the monolithic architecture ties the teams together so they couldn't operate independently. 

  With the new microservice architecture, Uber engineering soon became flexible and teams became independent. The new service provided a ***system reliability, separation of concerns, clear ownership, and developer velocity*** 

  In my case study, I want to talk about the better impact that the microservice architecture allowed the app to do. I want to show why more microservice is changing the way companies are expanding their services. How it can make a better impact and change how we build services today.
